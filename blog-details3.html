													Three Basic Rights of Workers Compensation Act
												</h1>
											</div>
										</div>

										<div class="post-cont">
											<h2 style="text-transform: none">
												What is Workers Compensation?
											</h2>

											<p>
												It is a government mandated process of paying benefits
												to employees who are injured or become ill on the job or
												as a result of their job. It is essentially a workers
												disability insurance policy that provides financial
												compensation, medical services, or both to workers who
												are injured or ill as an immediate consequence of their
												jobs. Workers compensation is also known as workers'
												comp.
											</p>

											<h2 style="text-transform: none">
												Workers Compensation Benefits
											</h2>

											<ul>
												<li>Observance of state regulations</li>
												<li>Medical treatment for an injured employee</li>
												<li>Benefits for temporary disability</li>
												<li>Benefits for permanent disability</li>
												<li>Additional job displacement benefits</li>
												<li>Death benefits</li>
											</ul>

											<h2 style="text-transform: none">
												What is Workers Compensation Insurance?
											</h2>

											<p>
												Workers compensation insurance provides medical, pay,
												and other financial rewards to employees who are injured
												or ill on the job. Most states mandate this coverage.
												Workers compensation insurance is often referred to as
												workman's compensation insurance or workers comp
												insurance.
											</p>

											<h2 style="text-transform: none">
												Workers Compensation Laws
											</h2>

											<p>
												Workers Compensation laws refer to state or federal
												statutes intended to protect workers and their families
												from the hazards of workplace injury, death, or illness.
												It is a type of employee insurance that is accounted by
												the employer.
											</p>

											<h2 style="text-transform: none">
												Three Basic Rights of Workers Compensation Act - Work
												Place Injuries
											</h2>

											<p>
												The Worker's Compensation Act secures three basic rights
												to injured workers: medical treatment, compensation for
												lost work time, and a settlement at the conclusion of
												your case.
											</p>

											<h3 style="text-transform: none">Medical Treatment</h3>

											<p>
												For an injury, the plaintiff deserves to get the medical
												care available and choose their own doctors.
											</p>

											<p>
												Through their Workers’ Compensation insurance carrier,
												the employer must pay for all necessary first aid,
												medical and surgical services, and hospital services.
											</p>

											<p>
												However, it is limited to what is reasonably necessary
												to cure or relieve the effects of the accidental injury.
											</p>

											<p>
												If the employer doesn’t dispute payment for first aid,
												medical, surgical, and hospital services, the employer
												shall make such payment to the provider on behalf of the
												employee.
											</p>

											<p>
												Plaintiff has the right to all prescribed medical
												treatment if it aids in your recovery, or if your doctor
												believes it will.
											</p>

											<p>
												The insurance company may hire their own doctor to argue
												that the treatment your doctor desires is not
												"reasonable and necessary," and thus will not pay for
												it.
											</p>

											<p>
												In addition to Independent Medical Exams, the insurance
												company may have a doctor review the medical records or
												submit the claim for "utilization review." These are all
												different approaches to achieving the same goal, which
												is to dispute bills.
											</p>

											<p>
												To summarise, your first right under the Workers'
												Compensation Act is to receive medical treatment. You
												choose your doctor, and that doctor prescribes treatment
												and refers you to other doctors.
											</p>

											<p>
												Workers' Compensation insurance should cover the costs
												of treatment as long as it is "necessary" and
												"reasonably required to cure or relieve the effects of
												the accidental injury."
											</p>

											<h3 style="text-transform: none">
												Compensation for Time off work
											</h3>

											<p>
												Compensation for periods of time when you are unable to
												work due to a work-related injury. It is said as
												Temporary Total Disability.
											</p>

											<p>
												Although this is a weekly benefit, many insurance
												companies prefer to pay it every two weeks (if at all).
												The weekly amount is calculated as two-thirds of your
												average weekly wage ("AWW"), subject to maximums and
												minimums.
											</p>

											<p>
												Temporary Total Disability, like all Workers'
												Compensation Act benefits, is tax-free. If you work
												regular hours, you can get a good estimate. Simply
												multiply the number of hours you work on a regular basis
												each week by the hourly rate.
											</p>

											<p>
												Also, to be noted is generally overtime is not factored
												into the average weekly wage.
											</p>

											<p>
												The important thing to remember is that the insurance
												adjuster will often underestimate the temporary total
												disability rate. So, if you believe you are being
												underpaid, notify the adjuster with the help of an
												attorney.
											</p>

											<p>
												To be eligible for temporary total disability, you must
												have your doctor provide you with work status slips on a
												regular basis.
											</p>

											<p>
												The doctor may order to take time off work or impose
												temporary restrictions that prevent you from performing
												your job.
											</p>

											<p>
												In the latter case, your boss may offer you light duty
												within your limitations. Your temporary total disability
												will be terminated if you refuse to even attempt this
												light duty.
											</p>

											<p>
												So, as long as you're within your limitations, show up
												for the light-duty job and give it you're all. If doing
												the job causes pain, see your doctor and have
												restrictions adjusted accordingly.
											</p>

											<h3 style="text-transform: none">
												Settlement based on the permanency of injury
											</h3>

											<p>
												It's time to start thinking about settling your claim
												once your medical condition has become permanent.
											</p>

											<p>
												Permanent indicates that, despite the fact that you may
												still be receiving therapy (at-home exercises,
												prescription medicines, and so on), your doctor has
												judged that you have reached Maximum Medical Improvement
												("MMI").
											</p>

											<p>
												At this stage, your doctor may refer you for a
												Functional Capacity Evaluation ("FCE") in order to
												impose permanent limitations on you.
											</p>

											<p>
												Consider the FCE as a ready-to-wear outfit that may
												require minor customization. After a few months on the
												job, you'll have a better idea of what you can and can't
												do.
											</p>

											<p>
												After the plaintiff returned to work, schedule a
												follow-up appointment with the doctor to adjust the
												limits as needed.
											</p>

											<p>
												The worth of your case is determined by a number of
												factors.
											</p>

											<p>
												The doctor may order to take time off work or impose
												temporary restrictions that prevent you from performing
												your job.
											</p>

											<p>
												These factors include the length of time you're out of
												work, the type of treatment you receive, whether that
												treatment includes surgery if you can return to your
												previous job or must find a new one, whether that new
												employment pays as well as the old one, and what
												permanent limits you have.
											</p>

											<p>
												Special requirements apply if you suffer disfigurement
												or an injury that causes permanent total incapacity, but
												this list covers the majority of circumstances.
											</p>

											<p>
												The determination of the level of permanent partial
												disability on the following factors:
											</p>

											<ol type="i">
												<li>The reported level of impairment pursuant</li>
												<li>The injured employee's occupation</li>
												<li>The employee's age at the time of the injury</li>
												<li>The employee's future earning capacity</li>
												<li>Evidence of disability</li>
											</ol>
